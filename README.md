# UW Madison GI tract segmentation
Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remain a major contributor to global cancer incidence and mortality. The manual segmentation of GI tract organs from MRI scans is often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inter-observer variability, leading to inconsistencies in diagnostic accuracy. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of semantic segmentation models, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures, which have significantly enhanced the automated identification of anatomical structures. To address the challenges in GI organ segmentation, we developed an automated pipeline capable of accurately delineating the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. This approach supports precise tumor localization and improves radiation therapy planning. The model was trained and validated using the UW-Madison GI Tract Segmentation dataset, which is a medical imaging dataset for segmentation of the small intestine, large intestine, and stomach in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Provided by the Department of Radiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, it contains 38,496 images, categorized into 3 classes: small intestine, large intestine, and stomach. These images have corresponding run-length encoded (RLE) masks for segmenting three GI organs: the stomach, small bowel, and large bowel. Images are stored in 16-bit grayscale PNG format. Each case has multiple scan slices organized by the day the scan was taken.The annotations are provided as Run length encoding masks.
